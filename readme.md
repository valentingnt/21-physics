# Physics 3D experimentation
Hey Sticker Mule's team ! I hope you're doing well.
I wanted to show you this particular project I made following the Threejs Journey course by Bruno Simon. In this particular project you can create boxes and spheres that react with each other. I tried to optimize everything so it works well in every browser and mobile devices.

## Setup locally
Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Run this followed commands:

``` bash
# Install dependencies (only the first time)
yarn install
or
npm install

# Run the local server at localhost:8080
yarn dev
or
npm run dev

# Build for production in the dist/ directory
yarn build
or
npm run build
```
